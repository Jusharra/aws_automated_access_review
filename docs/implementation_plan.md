# Implementation Plan: AWS Access Review

This document outlines the implementation plan for the AWS Access Review project.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)

### Tasks
- [x] Create basic CloudFormation template structure
- [x] Define Lambda function resource
- [x] Set up Lambda execution role with appropriate permissions
- [x] Implement S3 bucket for report storage
- [x] Configure SES for email delivery
- [x] Set up CloudWatch Events for scheduled execution

### Deliverables
- CloudFormation template with basic resources
- IAM roles and policies for Lambda execution
- S3 bucket configuration with appropriate lifecycle policies
- SES configuration for email sending

## Phase 2: Data Collection (Weeks 2-3)

### Tasks
- [x] Implement IAM policy analyzer
  - [x] Detect overly permissive policies
  - [x] Identify unused permissions
  - [x] Check for security best practices
- [x] Add Security Hub findings collector
  - [x] Query Security Hub API for IAM-related findings
  - [x] Process and categorize findings
- [x] Integrate IAM Access Analyzer
  - [x] Collect external access findings
  - [x] Process and prioritize results
- [x] Create SCP and RCP analyzers
  - [x] Analyze organization-level policies
  - [x] Identify policy conflicts or gaps
- [x] Develop CloudTrail log analyzer
  - [x] Detect suspicious activity patterns
  - [x] Identify unused permissions based on activity

### Deliverables
- Lambda function code for each analyzer component
- Integration with AWS security services
- Data collection and normalization logic
- Finding categorization and prioritization system

## Phase 3: Reporting & AI Integration (Week 4)

### Tasks
- [x] Design CSV report format
  - [x] Define columns and data structure
  - [x] Implement CSV generation logic
- [x] Set up Amazon Bedrock integration
  - [x] Configure API access
  - [x] Implement error handling and retries
- [x] Design prompt engineering for Titan model
  - [x] Create structured prompts for different scenarios
  - [x] Optimize for concise, actionable outputs
- [x] Create structured data formatter for AI input
  - [x] Transform findings into AI-friendly format
  - [x] Prioritize critical issues for narrative focus
- [x] Implement email formatting and delivery
  - [x] Design email template
  - [x] Implement attachment handling
  - [x] Set up delivery tracking

### Deliverables
- CSV report generator
- Amazon Bedrock integration code
- Prompt templates for Titan model
- Email delivery system with attachments

## Phase 4: Testing & Release (Week 5)

### Tasks
- [x] Test in various AWS account configurations
  - [x] Single account setup
  - [x] Multi-account organization
  - [x] Different service enablement scenarios
- [x] Create documentation and usage examples
  - [x] Update README with detailed instructions
  - [x] Create troubleshooting guide
  - [x] Document customization options
- [x] Publish to GitHub
  - [x] Set up repository
  - [x] Add license information
  - [x] Create contribution guidelines
- [x] Set up issue tracker for community contributions

### Deliverables
- Fully tested CloudFormation template
- Comprehensive documentation
- Public GitHub repository
- Contribution guidelines and issue templates

## Resource Requirements

### Development Resources
- AWS account with administrative access
- Amazon Bedrock access
- Development environment with AWS CLI and Python
- Test AWS accounts with various configurations

### Skills Required
- CloudFormation template development
- Python Lambda function development
- AWS security services knowledge (IAM, Security Hub, Access Analyzer)
- Amazon Bedrock API integration
- Email delivery systems (SES)

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. **Amazon Bedrock API Limits**: May impact processing of large environments
   - Mitigation: Implement batching and rate limiting

2. **Cross-Account Access**: Challenges with multi-account analysis
   - Mitigation: Document clear IAM role requirements for cross-account access

3. **Email Deliverability**: SES limitations in new accounts
   - Mitigation: Document SES setup requirements and alternatives

4. **Lambda Timeout**: Analysis of large environments may exceed Lambda limits
   - Mitigation: Optimize code and implement chunking for large environments

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:
1. CloudFormation template deploys successfully in a clean AWS account
2. Security analysis correctly identifies common IAM issues
3. AI-generated narrative provides clear, actionable insights
4. Email reports are delivered reliably with CSV attachments
5. Documentation is clear enough for users to deploy independently
